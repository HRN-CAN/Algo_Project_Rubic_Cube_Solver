# Rubik's Cube Solver
This Python script is a Rubik's Cube solver using the IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm. It includes functions for cube manipulation, movement application, and solving. The solver generates pruning tables for piece orientation and permutation, then searches for the solution with increasing depth.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
Python (>=3.6)
NumPy
-> pip install numpy
# Usage
1. Open the rubiks_cube_solver.py file.
2. Modify the cube_state variable in the __main__ block to set the initial cube state.
3. Run the script: python rubiks_cube_solver.py
The script will display the initial cube state, normalize the stickers, generate pruning tables, and start the search for the optimal solution using IDA*.
# Example
Here's an example of how to use the solver:
from rubiks_cube_solver import apply_algorithm_string, solve_cube
#Initialize cube state and apply an algorithm
cube_state = initialize_state()
cube_state = apply_algorithm_string(cube_state, "R U2 R2 F2 R' F2 R F R")
#Solve the cube
solve_cube(cube_state)
